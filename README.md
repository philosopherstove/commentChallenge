### What the Challenge Encompassed

The challenge was to create a JavaScript comment component that met the following requirements:

- visually match a provided mock.
- have its data separate from the template and pulled in from JavaScript.
- have the footer elements at the bottom of the comment, namely the "REPLY", "{n} REPLIES", and up/down arrows with related counts, coded as interactive elements. They do not, however, need to function.
- when the entire comment is hovered the light-grey aforementioned footer items should become visibly darker.
- include tests of some sort.
- include a README.
